In [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dj6ML_hRxrjZaoZhXGKEmnn1uEVV66yR/view?usp=drive_link), I showcase the third project of the Full stack Developer Program at Triple10. The project was created using HTML and CSS, implementing features like semantic HTML, Flexbox, Grid, and Responsive Design. I demonstrate how the layout adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, emphasizing the use of grid for a flexible card layout. No specific action is requested from viewers.
